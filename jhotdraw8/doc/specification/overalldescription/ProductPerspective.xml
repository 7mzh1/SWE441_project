  <para>"JHotDraw 8" is an object oriented framework for developing drawing editors in the Java programming
    language.</para>

  <para>It consists of two independent frameworks,
    and a number of demos ("samples"), which demonstrate typical uses of the framework.</para>

  <para>The "Drawing Editor Framework" can be used to realize drawing
    editors for computer aided design and for artistic drawings.
    Drawings can be animated and interactive. It is possible to back a drawing with
    a data model, allowing a structured drawing editor to be used as a user interface
    for the data model.</para>

  <para>The "Application Framework" can be used to create document-based
    applications that comply to platform-specific user interface guidelines.
    Such as <xref linkend="bib.ahig"/> and <xref linkend="bib.whig"/>.</para>

  <para>The "Mini" examples demonstrate small use cases from both frameworks.</para>

  <para>The "Grapher" example demonstrate a working drawing editor application. It focuses on many use cases
    of the application framework and the drawing framework.
    It exercises the "simple" implementation classes that are provided with the drawing framework.
  </para>

  <para>The "Modeler" example demonstrate a working drawing editor application. It focuses on many use cases
    of the application framework and the drawing framework.
    It adds implementation classes that exercise the extensibility of the drawing framework.
  </para>

  <para>The "Teddy" example demonstrates a working text editor. It focuses on the application framework.
    It exercises the "simple" implementation classes that are provided with the application framework.
  </para>
