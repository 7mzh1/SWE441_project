  <title>Layers</title>

  <para>We can support layers in a drawing by treating layers as a special
    kind of figures.
  </para>

  <para>Since we want to represent a drawing as a tree structure, we can require the following:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>A <code>Layer</code> can only have of a parent of type <code>Drawing</code>.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Any other type of <code>Figure</code> can only have of a parent
        that is not of type <code>Drawing</code>.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <section>
    <title>Trade-off</title>
    <para>The trade-off with this design is that we always must add at least one layer to a drawing,
      even if we don't need layers in that specific drawing.
