  <title>Layout Dependencies</title>
  <para>The layout of a figure can depend on the layout of other figures.</para>

  <para>In order to layout a drawing with such figures, we must first layout the figures
    that do not depend on other figures. Then we can continue to layout figures that depend on
    figures that we have already laid out until no more figures are left.
  </para>

  <para>The layout dependencies can be thought of as a directed graph.
    By sorting this directed graph topologically, we can get the sequence in which
    we must layout the figures.
  </para>
