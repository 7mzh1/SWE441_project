  <title>Graph as Directed Graph</title>
  <para>A graph <inlineequation><mathphrase>G = (V, E)</mathphrase></inlineequation>
    can by represented by a directed graph <inlineequation><mathphrase>DG = (V, A)</mathphrase></inlineequation>
  using the following mapping:</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>A vertex in the graph is mapped to a vertex in the directed graph:
    <inlineequation><mathphrase>V ∈ G ⇔ V ∈ DG</mathphrase></inlineequation>.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>Vertex mapping is bijective: <inlineequation><mathphrase>V ∈ G = V ∈ DG</mathphrase></inlineequation>.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><para>An edge in the graph is mapped to two arrows in the directed graph:
    <inlineequation><mathphrase>E ∈ G = A_k, A_l ∈ DG, E = (v_i, v_j), A_k = (v_i, v_j), A_l = (v_j, v_i), i ≠ j, k ≠ l, v ∈ V</mathphrase></inlineequation>.
  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>Edge to Arrow mapping is injective. We can not map every Directed Graph back to a Graph.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
  <para>This mapping is useful, because it allows to use algorithms for directed
  graphs on undirected graphs, without having to re-implement the algorithms.</para>
