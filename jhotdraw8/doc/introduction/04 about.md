About JHotDraw
==============

Versions 7 and 8
----------------
JHotDraw 7 and 8 were developed by Werner Randelshofer.

These versions focus on a rich feature set and on performance.


Version 6
---------
The JHotDraw 6 architecture was inspired by two sources:

*   HotDraw
    HotDraw is a drawing framework for Smalltalk. 
    It was originally developed by Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham.

*   ET++
    ET++ is a comprehensive and portable application framework and class library
    for C++. ET++ was developed by Andre Weinand and Erich Gamma. 

JHotDraw 6 was developed by Thomas Eggenschwiler and Erich Gamma. 
It was originally planned to be a trivial case study for an applied design
patterns seminar. But then it was too much fun to just stop there...
