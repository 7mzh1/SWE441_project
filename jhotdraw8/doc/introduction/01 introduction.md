Introduction to JHotDraw 8
============

JHotDraw 8 is a framework for drawing editors written in the Java programming
language.

It consists of two parts which can be used independently:

* the framework for structured drawing editors
* the framework for document-oriented applications

The framework for structured drawing editors can be used to realize drawing
editors for computer aided design and for artistic drawings. 
Drawings can be animated and interactive. It is possible to back a drawing with
a data model, allowing a structured drawing editor to be used as a user interface
for the data model.

The framework for document-oriented applications can be used to create 
applications which comply to platform-specific user interface guidelines. 
Such as such as Apple's [Mac OS X Human Interface Guidelines][1]
and Microsoft's [Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines][2].
