<para>An application is a computer program which is designed to perform a group of actions on a project.</para>

 <para>The nature of the project depends on a specific implementation of an application.</para>

   <para>Depending on the nature of a project, an application has typically one of the following application styles:</para>
 <itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para>'Utility'. Here, the application 'is' the project. The user can start the application and immediately
     perform actions, without ever having to select a project. Typical utility applications are: a calculator, a dictionary.</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>'Library-based'. Here, a project corresponds to a library. The user can start the application,
     and then the application automatically opens the previously used library (or libraries).
     The application provides actions on a library. Typically all changes are immediately made persistent in the library.
     Typical library-based applications are: a photo library, a music library.</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>'Document-based'. Here, a project corresponds to a document The user can start the application,
   and open an existing document or create a new one. The application provides actions on a working copy of the document.
   Changes are only made persistent when the user explicitly saves them to the document.
    Typical document-based applications are: a text editor, a drawing editor.</para>
   </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 
 <para>The purpose of the JHotDraw 8 application framework, is to support the creation of "Document-based" applications with Java.</para>
